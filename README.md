# InfoLens
InfoLens is an MVP/proof of concept web application for the mitigation of online disinformation.
Initial development began as part of my MSc thesis in Artificial Intelligence and I intend to extend it's capability over time.

Currently InfoLens functions as a Streamlit application, with a MongoDB database and machine learning backend, however in future its
front-end functionality could/should be extended using more versatile modern frameworks and libraries such as React/Next.
